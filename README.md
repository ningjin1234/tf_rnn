# tf_rnn
This is a TensorFlow based recurrent neural network for NLP and numeric sequence analysis. It supports sequence classification and regression and it also supports classification and regression for each token (timestep).

Some simple data sets are included:
* movie_reviews.txt is text data with sentiment scores converted from Stanford sentiment TreeBank data set (see movie_reviews_readme.txt for more details).
* toy_embedding.txt is a toy word embedding with only 9 words and 3 dimensions. It's for samples and small tests only.
* rand_docs.txt are random text data generated by randomly selecting words from toy_embedding.txt. It's for samples and small tests only.
* rand_num.txt are randomly numeric sequences with the same length.

The random data sets are generated by data_gen.py
